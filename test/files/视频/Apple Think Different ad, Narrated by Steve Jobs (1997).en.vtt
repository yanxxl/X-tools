Music

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.15
Here's to the crazy ones.

00:00:06.15 --> 00:00:12.264
The misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers,

00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:14.828
The round pegs in the square holes,

00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:18.574
The ones who see things differently.

00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:23.262
They are not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:29.624
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.

00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:33.716
About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:39.314
Because they change things.They push the human race forward.

00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:46.510
And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.222
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world,

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:55.6.0
are the ones who do.
